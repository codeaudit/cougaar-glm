Notes on Map Configuration:

Map configuration is mostly controlled by a bunch of ASCII 
files in the alpmap directory.  


jmap.views 
  lists the views and background images available from the main 
control window. The view lines name view (.vw) files in the alpmap 
directory and background images in the images directory (under 
Jmap).

*.vw
  The view files controlling what nodes go where.
  These are created and edited using NetMap.

i.nmdb
  database file from NetMap

alpmap.mbx
  a raw file of commands to be sent to the Map client;
  You configure menus here.

nms.init
  Initialization file for starting plugins, setting attributes, or whatever.
  The mbin command specifies the port to listen on - normally 5550.





Notes on web browsers:

Netscape 4.5, 4.6, and 4.61 seem to work great on Win32 systems. 
Internet Explorer 5.0 on Win98 has problems with web 
pages when using show.
