<h2>
<b>COUGAAR Society Startup and Configuration: COUGAAR 7.0</b></h2></center>

<h2>
<b>Overview</b></h2>
<font size=+0>To install COUGAAR 7.0, first unzip the "core-&lt;builddate>.zip"
file. It will create a top-level "alp-&lt;builddate>" directory and appropriate
subdirectories. Then move the toolkit-&lt;builddate>.zip, planserver-&lt;builddate>.zip,
server-&lt;builddate>.zip, contract-&lt;builddate>.zip,
glm-&lt;builddate>.zip, tutorial-&lt;builddate>.zip (optional) files to
the alp-&lt;builddate> directory and unzip them there.
This unzip process will overlay the original
structure with the appropriate files and subdirectories. As with previous
releases, the environment variable COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH should point to the
alp-&lt;builddate> directory.</font>
<p>To verify correct installation of the COUGAAR software, a small but non-trivial
test society relying only on ALPINE PlugIns is included in "alpine\configs\minitestconfig."
This society is configured to run in a single node on a single computer.
This configuration can be modified as required for PlugIn testing.&nbsp;
Minitestconfig features a reduced 4-cluster society with GLS initiating
at 3ID and flowing down to subordinate clusters. The ARBN cluster generates
Transport tasks that are eventually allocated to MCCGlobalMode. These tasks
are allocated and the allocation results propagated back to the task originator.
The task originator (ARBN) evaluates the results and modifies the task
preferences to achieve an acceptable solution. Subcontractors are encouraged
to bring their PlugIns up to full compliance with the new infrastructure
modifications, possibly using the minitestconfig society. A separate document
provides a <a href="MiniTestConfig.html">functional description of the
minitestconfig</a> society.
<p>The following "jar" files are used in the baseline society configuration
and are located in the alp\lib directory:
<ul>
<li>
core.jar: COUGAAR core infrastructure</li>

<li>
glm.jar: domain infrastructure support and Logistics Model PlugIns</li>

<li>
toolkit.jar: standalone utilities tools</li>

<li>
build.jar: code generators for COUGAAR software</li>

<li>
planserver.jar: tools for extracting, entering, and displaying information from COUGAAR</li>

<li>
xmlj_2_0_11.jar: XML parser</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<b>3rd Party Commercial Software</b></h2>
The COUGAAR society software depends on a number of freely distributed 3rd
party software packages. These software packages can be obtained free from
their respective sources. The <a href="https://www.alpine.bbn.com">ALPINE
web site</a> (HTTPS://www.alpine.bbn.com/) contains a list of freely available
3rd party commercial software in the "DSE Software" Area. For MiniBuild
6.x, we use the following versions of 3rd party software:

<h2>
<b>Installation and Configuration</b></h2>
Please read the following information carefully. The following information
describes the current organization of "jar" and data files and system parameters.
In addition, this information describes the organization of PlugIn software
submissions and how PlugIns must reference private data files and software
libraries.
<p>Unpacking the release packages (zip files) should produce the
following directory structure inside the new alp-&lt;builddate> directory:
<ul>
<li>

lib ---------------- "jar" files for the infrastructure, ALPINE PlugIns,
and COTS libraries</li>

<li>
bin ---------------- "bat" and "csh" scripts for setting environment
variables and paths</li>

<li>
configs ----------- subdirectories of society configuration files (e.g.,
minitestconfig)</li>

<li>
src --------------- infrastructure source code (in zip files)</li>

<li>
doc ------ Release Notes (release_notes_index.html) and other
	documentation for COUGAAR infrastructure.</li>

<li>
doc/javadoc ------"javadoc" for COUGAAR infrastructure</li>

<li>
&lt;product*>------ product specific data files and non-java executables
(each PlugIn or COUGAAR participant will have a corresponding subdirectory)</li>
</ul>
The following information describes the configuration scheme for ALPINE
software distributions. Please note the new organization of release software
and data files for PlugIn software and society configuration directories.
<ol>
<li>
There are environment variables and Java system properties as defined in
the table below. The purpose of these parameters is to control COUGAAR system
behavior and minimize placing environment variables in the Node.bat or
Node.csh files.</li>

<li>
The environment variable COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH must point to the installation
directory "alp-&lt;builddate>." This is used to set the (java) system
property org.cougaar.install.path which must 
point to the same directory. These variables will allow the infrastructure
and PlugIns to find the necessary "jar" files (lib) and data files
(&lt;product-n>).</li>

<li>
For system testing in a single node configuration, "serialization" of COUGAAR
objects can be forced by setting the org.cougaar.core.message.alwaysSerialize system
property to true. This feature cannot be used in a multiple node scenario
and should be false.</li>

<li>
Please note that the Node.bat/csh files are only present in the cougaar/bin
directory. They have been removed from all configuration directories to
encourage use of a single version in a standard location. We suggest adding
%COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH%\bin to your PATH environment variable.</li>

<li>
Although we have not tested all society configurations on all types of
processing platforms, all COUGAAR infrastructure software is compatible with
NT, UNIX and LINUX operating systems.</li>

<li>
The file "setlibpath.bat" in "core\bin" creates the path to all "jar" files
and "setarguments.bat" defines the command line arguments to&nbsp; java.exe,
rather than using "node.bat" to perform this function. All "node.bat" files
should call these files.</li>

<li>
Execution of "Node.bat" and "Node" (csh) requires passing the "node name"
as the first argument to these scripts, rather than coding them into the
scripts. The node name argument must match the node name used for the &lt;nodename>.ini
file.</li>

<li>
To find initialization files (e.g., clustername-prototype-ini.dat and OPlan.ini),
the infrastructure will first look in the local directory and then look
in the {$COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH}\configs\common.</li>
</ol>

<h2>
<b>Populating Clusters with Assets</b></h2>
The initial population of assets for a particular organization in MiniBuild
6.0 is handled by Data PlugIns, specifically the LDMXMLPlugIn&nbsp; that
reads assets from an XML formated file. Also included in the release is
an LDMSQLPlugIn that reads assets from the JTAV snapshot database on eiger.
Examples can be found in the alpine.plugin package. On start-up, the XML
PlugIns query the XML files and create the specified LDM objects. Note
that the ClusterAsset.ini file is no longer used in the test society.
<p>The JDBC drivers required for the LDMSQLPlugIns are freely available
from Oracle. All of our required functionality is available in a portable
ZIP file that needs to be added to the COUGAAR CLASSPATH. Oracle suggests that
the zip file be placed in $ORACLE_HOME/jdbc/lib/classes111.zip. While we
are not able to provide this zip file in the release, it is available on
the web: <a href="http://technet.oracle.com/software/download.htm">Oracle
JDBC Thin Drivers</a> (http://technet.oracle.com/software/download.htm).
