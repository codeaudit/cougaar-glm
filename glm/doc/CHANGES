Improved performance of the Inventory Manager by reducing number of times
it would run its cycle in response to a change in demand.   Now the Inventory
Manager will wait and decide when its customers have presented most of their
demand for the time being, before waking up, and starting its work cycle 
to handle the accumulated demand.

Within one of the inventory managers working cycles, enhancements were made 
to work more efficiently and trim down the number of tasks and responding 
results between clusters.

Reorganization of the Inventory Manager, its subclasses, and supporting 
classes for a cleaner design that generates better solutions.   Methods in 
subclasses were made more generic and moved to higher point in the class 
hierarchy to better isolate the points for overloading.   Better placement of
state/data items within appropriate classes.  The algorithm performed in an 
Inventory Managers work cycle was made smarter, more comprehensive, 
and truer to the miltary model from where it was abstracted.

Many bug fixes were made, not only functional, but some that will improve 
memory usage and performance.
