Notes on Configuration:

AlpMap configuration is mostly controlled by a bunch of ASCII files
in the alpmap directory.  Remember that this is
a work in progress and is subject to arbitrary changes.

jmap.views 
  lists the views and background images available from the main control window.

  The view lines name view (.vw) files in the alpmap directory and background
  images in the images directory (under Jmap).

*.vw
  The view files controlling what nodes go where.
  These are created and edited using NetMap.

i.nmdb
  database file from NetMap

alpmap.mbx
  a raw file of commands to be sent to the AlpMap client;
  You configure menus here.

nms.init
  Initialization file for starting plugins, setting attributes, or whatever.





Notes on web browsers:

Netscape 4.5, 4.6, and 4.61 seem to work great on Win32 systems. 
Internet Explorer 5.0 on Win98 has problems with web 
pages when using show.



Notes on creating jar and zip files:

C:\ProgFiles Ted\Xitami\webpages\jt11>
  jar cvf jm4.jar  *.class *.jmap images/c*f images/o*f images/s*f images/tonycat2.gif

Copy this jm4.jar file to C:\ProgFiles Ted\Xitami\webpages\jmap


In C:\ProgFiles Ted\Xitami\webpages\, delete or rename Jmap.zip

In Explorer, right click on C:\ProgFiles Ted\Xitami\webpages\Jmap,
select Add to Jmap.zip.
From C:\ProgFiles Ted\Xitami\webpages, copy Jmap.zip to 
D:\AlpMap\Dev\alpine\ui\orgviewServer\alpmap
