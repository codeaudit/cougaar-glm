Directions for installing the OrgView server and applet.


October 7, 1999.



  

To install the OrgView server, checkout the alpmap directory,
external/alpine/org.cougaar.domain.mlm.ui.orgviewServer/alpmap, into a suitable place.
This directory contains the configuration files needed to run
the orgviewServer.  It also contains a Jmap.zip file.

The Jmap.zip contains the applet components: Java jar file, html 
file and images to be served from a Web server.

Unzip Jmap.zip to create a directory named Jmap.

Make the Jmap directory a subdirectory of your web root directory.  
This could be a regular web server such as Apache or Xitami, or 
could be an Alp LogPlanServer. Leave the images directory as a 
subdirectory of Jmap.

To run the OrgView server, go to the directory that contains the 
Alpmap directory, open a Command prompt or xterm, and run 
org.cougaar.domain.mlm.ui.orgviewServer.NetMapServer with an apppropriate classpath, e.g.

  java -cp %ALP_INSTALL_PATH%\plugins\alpine.jar  org.cougaar.domain.mlm.ui.orgviewServer.NetMapServer

Leave the orgviewServer running;  you do not need to bring it down and
up with the society.


To access the applet, point your Java 1.1 capable browser at 
Jmap/Appjmap.html.  For example:
