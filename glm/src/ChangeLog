	Fixes bug #342
	In generateProjections, always terminate the previous refill
	projection on the switchover day and start a new one. This makes
	the first active refill projection be based on the reorder level
	just prior to the switchover day instead of earlier garbage.

        Add maintainAtCapacity flag.

	* org/cougaar/domain/mlm/construction/ConstructionInventoryManager.java
	* org/cougaar/domain/mlm/construction/ConstructionInventoryBG.java

	The above files were changed in order to introduce a new
	maintainAtCapacity boolean flag into the InventoryPolicy.
	Now, like the fillToCapacity flag which means the goal level should
	never go above capacity, maintainAtCapacity means the inventory
	level should never drop below the capacity level.

	The InventoryManager was effected to help set the flag and also
	getMinReorderLevel and getMaxReorderLevel were modified to handle
	the majority of the cases.   getMinReorderLevel now bumps up the 
	reorder level to capacity when maintainAtCapacity is set to true.
	getMaxReorderLevel always limits to capacity now.
	
	* glm/configs/common/InventoryPolicy-ARBN.ldm.xml
	Set the maintain at capacity flag to true for Ammo at battalions

2001-04-16  Mark Davis  <mdavis@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/domain/glm/ldm/asset/InventoryBG.java;
	First large part to fix for bug #207.
	Compute an NDays of Demand for every planning day and
	put it into an array.   This is based on a new call
	from InventoryManager that passes relevant policy information
	as well as the min and max level for the reorder level which
	is derived from subclasses of the InventoryManager.
	Moved getReorderLevel() and getGoalLevel() from InventoryManager,
	and accomplish the same behavior but now these methods are
	on the InventoryBG.

	* Set the reorder level to never return more than the capacity
	when getFillToCapacity() is turned on.  Also, take out the setting 
	of capacity to a higher level, was causing problems.  Many were 
	solved by above getFillToCapacity() fix, but Ray feels this capacity
	is not used for anything but a concept (not in any calculations 
	but to set reorder level, etc), so it should not be set on the 
	fly.   This is to fix bug #306

	* org/cougaar/domain/glm/plugins/inventory/InventoryManager.java:
	* org/cougaar/domain/glm/plugins/inventory/GeneralInventoryManager.java:
	In order to work with fix above, rip out all code for getGoalLevel
	and reorderLevel and replace call to those with calls to methods
	with same name on InventoryBG.

	These changes should allow for the desimination of the this information
	to the GUI's in the future.

	* org/cougaar/domain/mlm/construction/ConstructionInventoryManager.java
	In order to work with these fixes, take out the implementation
	of getReorderLevel() and replace with new getMaxReorderLevel() which
	encapsulates the same behavior.

	* org/cougaar/domain/glm/ldm/asset/InventoryBG.java:
	Fixes bug #312
	Return the first day of demand from getFirstPlanningDay if it is
	greater than today. This confines refills from an inventory
	manager to just prior to the first demand. Ideally, the first
	planning day would be the day that the manager arrives at its
	destination and is ready to conduct business, but there is no easy
	way to do this.

	* org/cougaar/domain/glm/plugins/inventory/InventoryManager.java:
	Part of fix for bug #306
	Move computation of boosted capacity into a separate method so it
	can be overridden. Used by AntsGeneralInventoryManager to avoid a
	cycle of increasing capacity to huge levels.

	* org/cougaar/domain/glm/plugins/inventory/InventoryManager.java:
	Temporary fix for bug #307
	Return false from isBattalionLevel when the cluster is SPTBN or TCBN.

	* org/cougaar/domain/glm/plugins/inventory/GeneralInventoryManager.java:
	Fixes bug #309
	Remove refillNeeded override. The override was checking for refill
	switchover day and claiming that no refill was needed after the
	switchover day. This is incorrect -- the refill is still needed,
	it just can't be satisfied by ordering a refill. Instead,
	orderRefill checks the switchover day and refuses to place an
	order after the switchover.

	* org/cougaar/domain/glm/plugins/inventory/GeneralInventoryManager.java:
	When the need for a previously failed refill goes to zero, don't
	remove the refill. Instead, change to quantity to be teeny. This
	avoids a problem where the IM would later attempt a refill on that
	day leading to an infinite cycle.

	* org/cougaar/domain/glm/plugins/inventory/InventoryManager.java:
	Accumulate negative projection rates and apply them at the next
	opportunity. Sometimes changing reorder levels imply a reduction
	in inventory level for which a negative projection rate would be
	necessary. We don't generate negative projections. Instead the
	effect is accumulated and used to reduce subsequent projections
	having positive rates.
	Fix the reorder profile code to confine observations to the
	boundaries of the projection being profiled. Looking beyond the
	boundary may cause the generation of excessive corrections that
	cannot be undone.

	* org/cougaar/domain/glm/ldm/asset/InventoryBG.java:
	Reimplement getNDaysDemand with an algorithm that prevents reorder
	levels from dropping; they can only increase. This is an attempt
	to improve the stability of the inventory manager. This
	implementation also requires that the level increase by a certain
	amount before it actually takes effect.

	* org/cougaar/domain/glm/plugins/inventory/InventoryManager.java:
	Fixes Bug #273
	Change end test on generateProjections to allow for the
	possibility that the number of days having valid projected demand
	may be less that the total planning days. The null returned when
	the end of valid demand is reached caused the NPE. Now the loop
	terminates when the end is reached.

	* org/cougaar/domain/glm/ldm/asset/InventoryBG.java:
	Addresses Bug #273
	Add checks that the type of quantity for this inventory is one
	that we know how to deal with. If the initial level of the
	inventory is of a type that is not understood, an exception is
	thrown. This is better than a later NPE, but the real fix is to
	accommodate the type of quantity.

	* org/cougaar/domain/glm/plugins/inventory/InventoryManager.java:
	Fix Bug #235
	Major change to adjustForInadequateInventory to incorporate refill
	processing as well. These cannot be done as indenpendent
	activities because the effect of removing demand (dueouts) must be
	accounted for before refill processing for the following days.
	Now, for each day the following happens:
	   if there is a failed refill:
	       adjust quantity of the failed refill to the bare minimum
	   else
	       order a refill if needed
	   if a refill was needed but couldn't be ordered
	       fail enought dueouts to bring the inventory up to the
	       reorder level
        Adjust generated projections to account for shifting reorder level
	using a horizon following algorithm. This algorithm adjusts refill
	projections with a profile that overbounds the average of the goal
	and reorder levels.

	* org/cougaar/domain/glm/plugins/inventory/GeneralInventoryManager.java: 
	Fix Bug #235
	Implement three methods of altering existing refills:
	REFILL_ALTER_TASK -- change task preferences
	REFILL_REPLACE_TASK -- rescind and issue new task
	REFILL_ADD_TASK -- add another task for the increment
	Inventories are now refilled as part of
	"adjustForInadequateInventory. This is necessary because refills
	subsequent to a failed refill cannot be done until the dueouts are
	failed to bring inventory levels back up.
	orderRefill now adjusts the quantity of previous orders that have
	failed down to the minimum amount required to reach the reorder
	level.
	Refactor orderRefill into orderNewRefill parallel to
	orderRefillWithPrevious.

	Kludge to propagate AllocationResult changes to the supply

2001-03-01  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* InventoryPolicy -- et. al.
	Add policy-based ProjectionWeight creation.

	New class InventoryPolicy replaces DaysOnHandPolicy and includes
	all the RuleParameters from the latter plus optional
	RuleParameters setting the RefillSwitchoverDay and
	WithdrawSwitchoverDay values for ProjectionWeight creation.
	
	The InventoryPlugIn now maintains the default ProjectionWeight for
	a class of supply. The default ProjectionWeight is created as
	needed using the createProjectionWeight method. This method may be
	overridden to provide a particular default. The former projection
	weight creation has been retained by overriding this method.
	
	A new setProjectionWeight method allows the default to be reset.
	This is used when an InventoryPolicy is encountered that specifies
	new switchover days. This method may also be overridden to ignore
	the policy-based projection weights.
	
	The default default projection weight (that's two defaults) is
	implemented by a new ProjectionWeightImpl class. Which may also be
	used to create fixed switchover day based projection weights.

2001-02-27  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* UIInventoryImpl
	Return schedules based on start time for non-projected dueouts.
	The start time corresponds to when the inventory level is
	decremented. The end time corresponds to when the items arrive at
	the destination. The latter may be a due in for another inventory
	where it will use the end time of the task/allocation.

	This change only applies to tasks with the WITHDRAW verb and their
	allocations. (Green bars on the chart).

2001-02-20  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* SubscriptionClient
	ThreadLocal variable current can be set to record the current
	SubscriptionClient being executed by a thread. This information
	then becomes available to code running in the thread to reveal the
	identity of the current SubscriptionClient. This is especially
	useful when composing error messages.

	* PlugInAdapter
	Set the SubscriptionClient.current ThreadLocal variable to be the
	current plugin. This variable is then accessible for additional
	information in debug printouts.

	* Subscriber
	Catch PublishException and print error messages describing the
	details of the publishing error.

	* ALPPlan
	Check that an object being added to the allObjects container is
	not already in the container and that an object being removed from
	the allObjects container is, in fact, in the container. In both
	cases a PublishException is thrown. The exception may contain a
	PublishStack from the prior activity that is in conflict with the
	current, erroneous activity. This latter behavior is enabled by
	the org.cougaar.core.cluster.savePriorPublisher system property
	being true. The default is false since keeping the history is
	expensive, but invaluable for debugging publishing errors.

	* PublishStack
	A Throwable having a SubscriptionClient field to record the state
	of a SubscriptionClient publishing something.

	* PublishException
	RuntimeException signifying something wrong with the publishing of
	an object. Used by ALPPlan.

2001-02-15  Ray Tomlinson  <rtomlinson@bbn.com>

	* InventoryPlugIn
	Maintains the DueOutPredicate. This is the predicate used by the
	WithdrawAllocator to select Tasks to allocate against inventories
	of a supply type. Putting it in the plugin makes it accessible to
	the InventoryManager (which see).

	* WithdrawAllocator
	Gets the DueOutPredicate from the InventoryPlugIn instead of
	creating it itself.

	* InventoryManager
	Publishes a DeletionPolicy reflecting the need to keep due out
	Tasks in the LogPlan in order to compute NDaysDemand. The deletion
	delay specified by the policy tracks the daysBackward_ variable.
	The predicate of the DeletionPolicy is the DueOutPredicate
	obtained from the InventoryPlugIn.

	* PropagationPlugIn
	Only re-propagate when an organization changes due to a change in

	* org.cougaar.domain.glm.plugins.projection.GenerateSupplyDemandExpander
	Removed dependency on OPlan for determining time phased location.

	* org.cougaar.domain.glm.plugins.inventory.SupplyExpander
	Using LocationSchedulePG for FROM Prep in creation of Transport Tasks.
	If LocationSchedulePG is not present on Organization, HomeLocation is used.
	
2001-01-05 Noelle Givler <ngivler@bbn.com>
	* Several
	Replaced use of Iterator over Schedules. Depending on the use, code
	was converted to iterate over either a full copy of the Schedule - 
	ArrayList copy = new ArrayList(schedule)
	- or a prescreened subset - 
	Collection screened = schedule.filter(predicate)
 	
	
2000-11-21  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* Several
	Use alp.util.OptionPane instead of javax.swing.JOptionPane to cure
	dialog size problems in demo mode. Not every instance has been
	converted. The remainder can be converted as needed.

2000-11-10  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* Everywhere
	All uses of DEMANDRATE prepositional phrase (and DEMANDMULTIPLIER)
	have been converted to use preferences and allocation results
	instead. This enables changing these values without rescinding and
	allows failback to be implemented.

	* AlpineAspectType
	Contains aspect type definitions and utilities for aspect types
	that are not part of the core. Specifically, DEMANDRATE and
	DEMANDMULTIPLIER aspects.

2000-11-03  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* TimedTaskEventReport
	Fixed Bug #73

2000-09-15  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Various
	Update references to old Rate measure to AbstractRate.

2000-09-11  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* alpprops.def
	Add some AirLiftPG slots for TOPS.

2000-08-25 Jim Winston    <jwinston@bbn.com>
	* DetailRequestLP, QueryRequest, OplanCoupon, GetOplanPlugIn
	Added directive messages and support in logic provider for querying
	remote logplans. The first use is for Oplan propagation. Instead
	of sending the entire Oplan to all clusters, they get an OplanCoupon
	instead. The GetOplanPlugIn uses the new query method to retrieve
	only the pertinent pieces of the Oplan from its home cluster.

2000-08-11 Jim Winston    <jwinston@bbn.com>

	* LightweightManifest
	Added LightweightManifest capability. Consists of new logic provider,
	asset, property group, and directives
	
2000-08-11  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* OPlan
	Fix some gross inefficiencies in OPlan data structure.  Share as
	much immutable structure as possible.  This cuts the serialized
	size in half.

2000-07-21  Jim Winston    <jwinston@bbn.com>
	* mil.darpa.log.alp.domain.oplan
	oplanID is a String again
	There is a UID as well as an oplanID
	OplanContributors get/set OplanUID
	
2000-07-17  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* AssignedPG (alpprops.def)
	Deprecate all accessors of AssignedPG because RelationshipSchedule 
	is the new new thing.

2000-06-21  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* OrgRTDataPlugIn
	Fix reflection to be able to construct Roles and other
	interning-like plan objects.

2000-06-02  Beth DePass  <bdepass@bbn.com>
  
  * GLS PlugIns
  Update wrt propagation changes
  
2000-05-23  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* FoodPG
	Removed refrigeration attributes, added type attribute (SRA).

2000-05-17  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* DirectiveMessage, etc.
	Propagate all ChangeReports through LPs and through message sends.
	
2000-05-09  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* ChangeReporter
	A trivial plugin which watches and reports on detailed change
	information going through the logplan.

2000-04-14  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* StrategicTransportProjectorPlugIn
	Update so that it really works under 6.x.

2000-04-04  Jim Winston    <jwinston@bbn.com>
	* mil.darpa.log.alp.domain.oplan
	oplanID is now a UID instead of a String
	
2000-03-21  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* All
	Finish removal of JGL

2000-03-06  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* OrgRTDataPlugIn
	Update using real object for ClusterIdentifiers

2000-03-03  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* mil.darpa.log.alp.domain
	ALP (logistics) domain moved from core.

2000-02-16  Ray Tomlinson  <rtomlinson@bbn.com>

	* OPlanPlugIn
	Remember if Oplan has been published in a private state variable
	so the GUI can be correct after rehydration.

	* GLSGUIInitPlugIn
	Use Oplan from OplanPlugIn instead of create our own.

	* GLSGUIInitPlugIn
	Add private state variable to count root tasks sent. Include the
	count in the feedback in the GUI. Disable the button until all the
	ducks are lined up and it is legitimate to send a root
	task. Include the task number in the task using "Sequence"
	preposition.

1999-12-17  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Various
	Fix ambiguous method references: these are cases where a method is 
	accessible via both inheritance and enclosing (outer) instances.
	Fix overgeneralization of try-catch(Exception) where
	try-catch(RuntimeException) is more appropriate.

	* ConnectionPool, Connection, ThreadedPlanServer
	Reimplement ConnectionPool - Less expensive, configurable options, 
	support for multiple instances, cleaner handshaking, more
	documentation and diagnostics.  Also moved Connection to a
	separate file.

1999-11-22  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* StrategicTransportProjectorPlugIn
	Prevent silly traversal of parent tasks across cluster boundaries.

1999-11-19  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* PropagationPlugIn
	Only propagate top-level transferrables, not
	OplanContributors. Warn about and then ignore OplanContributor
	directives in forwarding files (e.g. forward.xml).

	* OplanPlugIn, OplanFileReader
	Load Oplan objects to match new Oplan layout with
	OplanContributors as attatched Oplan parts which also get entered
	into the logplan.
	
	* OrgReportPlugIn
	Attempt to solve the problem where a rescind of an ReportForDuty
	directive cannot figure out how to reconnect the org to it's old
	superior.  The hacked solution is to assume that the org which
	directed the reassignment in the first place should be the new
	superior. 

1999-10-14  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* OrgRTDataPlugIn
	Make primitive types really work.  example:
		[MilitaryOrgPG]
		IsReserve	boolean	"true"

	Make complex objects as values work in the case of LDMF-created
	objects.  The syntax is an extension of the current one.  A PG
	value line may look like: 
		Property	TypeToCreate	parameters
	where Property is an interface, e.g. in alp.ldm.plan that the LDMF 
	can create with no arguments, and paramters is a comma-separated
	string like:
		"Slot1=value, Slot2=type value"
	Note that there are two allowed slot/value syntaxes.  If no value
	type is specified, it assumes String.  The first form looks for a
	method on the LDMF-created object "obj" of the signature
	"setSlot1(String)".  The second form will create an object of the
	spec "type value", which may be any sort of object, including
	other LDMF objects or even Collection types, and then looks for a
	"setSlot2" method which will accept the result type.  Example:
		[MilitaryOrgPG]
		HomeLocation	GeolocLocation "GeolocCode=BBNV, IcaoCode=String KBOS"	
	A better implementation of the first form (implicit type) and look 
	for a setter which takes a type that is known to be constructable
	with a string.
	
1999-10-04  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* OrgRTDataPlugIn
	Lowercase type specifiers in cluster ini files are now interpreted 
	as builtin types rather than wrapper classes.

1999-09-23  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* ChangeLog
	Added a ChangeLog for alpine plugins.
