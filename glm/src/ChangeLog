	* OplanWatcherLP
	Reinstate logplan.change(selfOrg) when org activities cause the
	location schedule to change.

	* OrgReportPlugIn
	When resending asset transfers due to changes to the self
	organization, pass through the change reports.

	* PropagationPlugIn
	Only re-propagate when an organization changes due to a change in
	relationships as indicated by the presence of
	RelationshipSchedule.RelationshipScheduleChangeReport in the
	change report collection.

2001-02-02 Mark Davis <mdavis@bbn.com>
	* org.cougaar.domain.mlm.ui.planviewer.inventory.InventoryChart
	and others in that package.

	Made compatible to both build and run Inventory GUI with new Sitraka JChart upgrade (new jcchart451K.jar to replace old jcchart400K.jar in core).
Cannot mix and match different builds of glm and core across this date.
	
2001-01-11 Jim Winston <jwinston@bbn.com>
	* org.cougaar.domain.mlm.plugin.generic.PropgationPlugIn
	* org.cougaar.domain.mlm.plugin.ldm.XMLPolicyPlugIn
	Both PlugIns now accept more than one XML file parameter. 
	
2001-01-11 Amy Fedyk <afedyk@bbn.com>
	* org.cougaar.domain.glm.plugins.projection.GenerateSupplyDemandExpander
	Removed dependency on OPlan for determining time phased location.
	Made use of LocationSchedulePG on Organization.  This necessitates
	that Plugins populate this PG on the Organization.
	
	* org.cougaar.domain.glm.plugins.inventory.SupplyExpander
	Using LocationSchedulePG for FROM Prep in creation of Transport Tasks.
	If LocationSchedulePG is not present on Organization, HomeLocation is used.
	
2001-01-05 Noelle Givler <ngivler@bbn.com>
	* Several
	Replaced use of Iterator over Schedules. Depending on the use, code
	was converted to iterate over either a full copy of the Schedule - 
	ArrayList copy = new ArrayList(schedule)
	- or a prescreened subset - 
	Collection screened = schedule.filter(predicate)
 	
	
2000-11-21  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* Several
	Use alp.util.OptionPane instead of javax.swing.JOptionPane to cure
	dialog size problems in demo mode. Not every instance has been
	converted. The remainder can be converted as needed.

2000-11-10  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* Everywhere
	All uses of DEMANDRATE prepositional phrase (and DEMANDMULTIPLIER)
	have been converted to use preferences and allocation results
	instead. This enables changing these values without rescinding and
	allows failback to be implemented.

	* AlpineAspectType
	Contains aspect type definitions and utilities for aspect types
	that are not part of the core. Specifically, DEMANDRATE and
	DEMANDMULTIPLIER aspects.

2000-11-03  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* TimedTaskEventReport
	Fixed Bug #73

2000-09-15  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Various
	Update references to old Rate measure to AbstractRate.

2000-09-11  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* alpprops.def
	Add some AirLiftPG slots for TOPS.

2000-08-25 Jim Winston    <jwinston@bbn.com>
	* DetailRequestLP, QueryRequest, OplanCoupon, GetOplanPlugIn
	Added directive messages and support in logic provider for querying
	remote logplans. The first use is for Oplan propagation. Instead
	of sending the entire Oplan to all clusters, they get an OplanCoupon
	instead. The GetOplanPlugIn uses the new query method to retrieve
	only the pertinent pieces of the Oplan from its home cluster.

2000-08-11 Jim Winston    <jwinston@bbn.com>

	* LightweightManifest
	Added LightweightManifest capability. Consists of new logic provider,
	asset, property group, and directives
	
2000-08-11  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* OPlan
	Fix some gross inefficiencies in OPlan data structure.  Share as
	much immutable structure as possible.  This cuts the serialized
	size in half.

2000-07-21  Jim Winston    <jwinston@bbn.com>
	* mil.darpa.log.alp.domain.oplan
	oplanID is a String again
	There is a UID as well as an oplanID
	OplanContributors get/set OplanUID
	
2000-07-17  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* AssignedPG (alpprops.def)
	Deprecate all accessors of AssignedPG because RelationshipSchedule 
	is the new new thing.

2000-06-21  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* OrgRTDataPlugIn
	Fix reflection to be able to construct Roles and other
	interning-like plan objects.

2000-06-02  Beth DePass  <bdepass@bbn.com>
  
  * GLS PlugIns
  Update wrt propagation changes
  
2000-05-23  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* FoodPG
	Removed refrigeration attributes, added type attribute (SRA).

2000-05-17  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* DirectiveMessage, etc.
	Propagate all ChangeReports through LPs and through message sends.
	
2000-05-09  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* ChangeReporter
	A trivial plugin which watches and reports on detailed change
	information going through the logplan.

2000-04-14  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* StrategicTransportProjectorPlugIn
	Update so that it really works under 6.x.

2000-04-04  Jim Winston    <jwinston@bbn.com>
	* mil.darpa.log.alp.domain.oplan
	oplanID is now a UID instead of a String
	
2000-03-21  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* All
	Finish removal of JGL

2000-03-06  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* OrgRTDataPlugIn
	Update using real object for ClusterIdentifiers

2000-03-03  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* mil.darpa.log.alp.domain
	ALP (logistics) domain moved from core.

2000-02-16  Ray Tomlinson  <rtomlinson@bbn.com>

	* OPlanPlugIn
	Remember if Oplan has been published in a private state variable
	so the GUI can be correct after rehydration.

	* GLSGUIInitPlugIn
	Use Oplan from OplanPlugIn instead of create our own.

	* GLSGUIInitPlugIn
	Add private state variable to count root tasks sent. Include the
	count in the feedback in the GUI. Disable the button until all the
	ducks are lined up and it is legitimate to send a root
	task. Include the task number in the task using "Sequence"
	preposition.

1999-12-17  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Various
	Fix ambiguous method references: these are cases where a method is 
	accessible via both inheritance and enclosing (outer) instances.
	Fix overgeneralization of try-catch(Exception) where
	try-catch(RuntimeException) is more appropriate.

	* ConnectionPool, Connection, ThreadedPlanServer
	Reimplement ConnectionPool - Less expensive, configurable options, 
	support for multiple instances, cleaner handshaking, more
	documentation and diagnostics.  Also moved Connection to a
	separate file.

1999-11-22  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* StrategicTransportProjectorPlugIn
	Prevent silly traversal of parent tasks across cluster boundaries.

1999-11-19  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* PropagationPlugIn
	Only propagate top-level transferrables, not
	OplanContributors. Warn about and then ignore OplanContributor
	directives in forwarding files (e.g. forward.xml).

	* OplanPlugIn, OplanFileReader
	Load Oplan objects to match new Oplan layout with
	OplanContributors as attatched Oplan parts which also get entered
	into the logplan.
	
	* OrgReportPlugIn
	Attempt to solve the problem where a rescind of an ReportForDuty
	directive cannot figure out how to reconnect the org to it's old
	superior.  The hacked solution is to assume that the org which
	directed the reassignment in the first place should be the new
	superior. 

1999-10-14  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* OrgRTDataPlugIn
	Make primitive types really work.  example:
		[MilitaryOrgPG]
		IsReserve	boolean	"true"

	Make complex objects as values work in the case of LDMF-created
	objects.  The syntax is an extension of the current one.  A PG
	value line may look like: 
		Property	TypeToCreate	parameters
	where Property is an interface, e.g. in alp.ldm.plan that the LDMF 
	can create with no arguments, and paramters is a comma-separated
	string like:
		"Slot1=value, Slot2=type value"
	Note that there are two allowed slot/value syntaxes.  If no value
	type is specified, it assumes String.  The first form looks for a
	method on the LDMF-created object "obj" of the signature
	"setSlot1(String)".  The second form will create an object of the
	spec "type value", which may be any sort of object, including
	other LDMF objects or even Collection types, and then looks for a
	"setSlot2" method which will accept the result type.  Example:
		[MilitaryOrgPG]
		HomeLocation	GeolocLocation "GeolocCode=BBNV, IcaoCode=String KBOS"	
	A better implementation of the first form (implicit type) and look 
	for a setter which takes a type that is known to be constructable
	with a string.
	
1999-10-04  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* OrgRTDataPlugIn
	Lowercase type specifiers in cluster ini files are now interpreted 
	as builtin types rather than wrapper classes.

1999-09-23  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* ChangeLog
	Added a ChangeLog for alpine plugins.
